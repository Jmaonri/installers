# Cobblemon Installer

A [Cobblemon](https://cobblemon.com/) installer that installs all the required mods + an option for a resourcepack and shaderpack combo.
This installer will also create a profile in your minecraft launcher.

All code is within program.cs's main function. I did this to make it easier for people with a minimal programming
knowledge to be get a vague understanding of the source code and find it trustworthy, although this was
a very dumb idea looking back.

## THIS REQUIRES [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.100-rc.2-windows-x64-installer) TO BE INSTALLED.

>"This code sucks"

I know.
